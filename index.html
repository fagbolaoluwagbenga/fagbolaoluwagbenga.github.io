                    procurement or Community's member recruitment, are dealt with in an open, fair and impartial manner.
                    This Code of Conduct sets out the basic standard of conduct expected of all Community's member and the Community's  policy on
                    matters like acceptance of advantages and con ict of interest of Community's member in connection with their official duties. This
                    Code also applies to temporary and part-time Community's member employed by the Community .
                </p>
				<p><br><br><em>Principle 2:</em>   Equal Opportunity for All Employees <br>
                    The Community  is an equal employment opportunity employer. Employment opportunities are available regardless of
                    race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability or other legally protected status. This Principle applies to all
                    aspects of the employment relationship, including recruiting, hiring, training, work assignment, promotion, transfer,
                    termination, and wage and salary administration.
                </p>
				<p><br><br><em>Principle 3:</em>  Safety, and Health Practices <br>
                    The Community  is committed to an injury-free and illness-free workplace that is operated in an environmentally sound
                    manner in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations that protect worker safety and the environment.
                    Employees should perform work in a safe manner.
                </p>
				<p><br><br><em>Principle 4:</em> Fair Competition<br>
                    The Community's  policy will prohibit any anticompetitive practices which could effect in bounding, restraining or
                    distorting competition, as well as any practices of an unfair competition. Accordingly, our employees cannot agree
                    (formally or informally) with competitors to x prices or any other conditions of transaction; to limit or control the
                    production, commercialization, technical development or investment; to manipulate or divide markets or sources
                    of provisioning; to participate with fake offers in tenders or any other forms of competitions for offers; to limit or
                    restrain access to market and freedom of competition for other enterprises; to apply unequal conditions for
                    equivalent performance to commercial partners, creating in this way a disadvantage in competition; to condition
                    signing of acceptancy contracts by the partners for supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according
                    to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.
                    Our employees are prohibited from performing any act of unfair competition manifested through: misappropriating
                    clients of a Community  by using the relations established with such clients within the function previously held at the
                    Community , dismissal or attracting employees of a Community  for the purpose of setting up a competing Community  to
                    capture customers of that Community  or hiring employees of a Community  in order to disorganize of its work. At the
                    same time, our employees must not take actions that harm the legitimate interests of consumers or other operations
                    in breach of the competition law.
                 </p>
				<p><br><br><em>Principle 5:</em>   Governance and anti-corruption <br>
                    The Community  has zero tolerance for corruption. All employees must never offer to provide anything of value directly
                    or indirectly to government officials and business partners to secure an undue advantage. The Community  prohibits
                    payment, offers of payment as well as anything of value directly or indirectly with the purpose of in uencing or
                    obtaining undue business or personal advantage.
                    Third parties will only be contracted to perform tasks which aid business interests provided: fees to be paid are
                    reasonable; all arrangements are clearly documented; arrangements are in compliance with Community's  policies.
                 </p>
				<p><br><br><em>Principle 6:</em>  Financial Reporting <br>
                    All transactions of the Community  must be duly recorded so as to permit preparation of clear financial statements in
                    conformity with generally accepted accounting Principles. No false or misleading entries may be made in the books
                    and records of the Community  for any reason, and no employee may engage in any arrangement that results in such
                    a prohibited act.
                    No undisclosed or unrecorded fund or asset of the Community  may be established for any purpose. No payment on
                    behalf of the Community  (including those by cash) may be done without adequate supporting documentation or
                    made with the intention or understanding that any part of such payment is to be used for any purpose other than
                    as described by the documents supporting the payment.
                    From time to time, the Community  may publish or inform of policies on financial reporting, disclosure and compliance
                    to reinforce the financial reporting expectations in this Code. All employees at any level are expected to implement
                    and strictly follow these policies.
                </p>
				<p><br><br><em>Principle 7:</em>  Restrictive Agreements with Third Parties <br>
                    The Community  does not condone activities that seek to gain an unfair competitive advantage. No individual may
                    engage in any activity which violates any valid restrictive agreements entered into by that individual for the bene t
                    of a third party, and no individual may, directly or indirectly, use or disclose any con dential information or trade
                    secrets of a third party that the individual obtained while employed by or associated with such third party.
                 </p>
				<p><br><br><em>Principle 8:</em>  Government Contracts and Services <br>
                    The Community  is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations relating to government (public
                    procurement) contracts and services and to ensuring that its reports, certi cations and declarations to government
                    officials are accurate and complete and that any deviations from contract requirements are properly approved.
                 </p>
				<p><br><br><em>Principle 9:</em> Acceptance of Advantages <br>
                    It is the policy of this Community  to prohibit all Community's member from soliciting or accepting any advantage from any persons
                    having business dealings with the Community  (e.g. clients, suppliers, contractors). Employees who wish to accept
                    any advantage from such persons should seek advice and permission from the responsible ethics officer.
                    Any gifts offered voluntarily to the Community's member in their official capacity are regarded as gifts to the Community  and they
                    should not be accepted without permission. By default, Community's member should decline the offer if the acceptance could be
                    perceived as against the interest of the Community , or that of society, or lead to complaints of bias or impropriety.
                    For gifts presented to Community's member in their official capacity and of low nominal value (below 1000 MDL), the refusal of which
                    could be seen as unsociable or impolite, can be exceptionally accepted. In other circumstances, the Community's member should
                    seek for a clear (i.e. in writing) and immediate (within 5 days from the offer) consent from the ethics officer to
                    accept the gifts.
                    The ethics officer should keep proper records of the applications and permissions. Each permission will indicate the
                    name of the applicant; the occasion of the offer; the nature and estimated value of the gift, and whether permission
                    has been granted for the applicant to retain the gift or other directions have been given to dispose of the gift. The
                    permissions must be signed and dated by both the ethics officer and the applicant. Possible ways of disposal of such
                    gifts are listed at Appendix 2.
                </p>
				<p><br><br><em>Principle 10:</em>  conflict of Intrest <br>
                    A conflict of interest situation arises when the “private interests” of the Community's member compete or conflict with the interests of
                    the Community . “Private interests” means both the financial and personal interests of the Community's member or those of their
                    connections including: family members and other close affiliates; personal friends; the clubs and societies to which
                    they belong; and any person to whom they owe a favor or are obligated in any way.
                    Community's member should avoid using their official position or any information made available to them in the course of their duties
                    to bene t themselves, their affiliates or any other persons with whom they have personal or social ties. They should
                    avoid putting themselves in a position that may lead to an actual or perceived con ict of interest with the Community .
                    Failure to avoid or declare any con ict of interest may give rise to criticism of favoritism, abuse of authority or even
                    allegations of corruption.
                    In particular, Community's member involved in the procurement process should declare con ict of interest if they have bene cial
                    interest in any Community  which is being considered for selection as the Community  supplier of goods or services.
                    Appendix 3 provides some examples of con ict of interest situations that may be encountered by Community's member .
                    When called upon to deal with matters of the Community  for which there is an actual or perceived con ict of interest,
                    the community member should make a declaration in writing to the ethics officer. He should then abstain from dealing
                    with the matter in question or follow the instruction of the ethics officer who may reassign the task to other Community's member .
                </p>
                <p><br><br><em>Principle 11:</em> Misuse of Official Position <br>
                    Community's member who misuses their official position for personal gains or to favour their relatives or friends are liable to disciplinary
                    action or even prosecution. Examples of misuse include a community member responsible for the selection of suppliers
                    giving undue favour or leaking information to his/her relatives Community  with a view to giving away an
                    undue advantage.

                </p>
                <p><br><br><em>Principle 12: </em> Misuse of Official Position <br>
                    Community's member is not allowed to disclose any classified or exclusive information to anybody without authorization. Community's member who
                    have access to or are in control of such information should at all times provide adequate safeguards to prevent its
                    abuse or misuse. Examples of misuse include disclosure of information in return for monetary rewards, or use of
                    information for personal interest. It should also be noted that unauthorized disclosure of any personal data may
                    result in a breach of the applicable legislation on privacy.

                    
                </p>
                <p><br><br><em>Principle 13:</em> Property of the Community  <br>
                    Community's member given access to any property of the Community  should ensure that it is properly used for the purpose of
                    conducting the Community's  business. Misappropriation of the property for personal use or resale is strictly prohibited.                    
                </p>
                <p><br><br><em>Principle 14:</em> Outside Employment <br>
                    Employees who wish to take up paid outside work, including those on a part-time basis, must seek the written (date
                    and signed) permission and guidance from the ethics officer before accepting the job. Approval will not be given if
                    the outside work is considered to be in conflict with the interest and values of the corporation.
                    
                </p>
                <p><br><br><em>Principle 15:</em> Compliance with the Code <br>
                    It is the personal responsibility of every community member to understand and comply with the Code of Conduct. Every
                    member of the Community's member shall sign a declaration of Principle to this purpose. The ethics officer or other mandated
                    employee will keep declarations of Principle.
                    Higher ranked employees should ensure that their subordinates understand and comply with the standards and
                    requirements stated in the Code. Any doubts of interpretation or problems encountered, as well as any suggestions
                    for improvement, should be addressed to the ethics officer for consideration and advice.
                    Any community member who violates any provision of the Code will be subject to disciplinary action. In cases of suspected
                    corruption or other criminal offences, a report will be made to the appropriate authorities.
                    
                </p>

                    discipline actions and sanctions in accordance with the labor law.
                    Once a complaint has been placed, the ethics officer will initially analyze it and s/he may meet privately with the
                    applicant to understand the facts surrounding the issue. Following a fact- nding phase, an investigative meeting
